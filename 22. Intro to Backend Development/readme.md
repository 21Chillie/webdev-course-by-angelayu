# 🛠️ Section 22 – Introduction to Backend Development

This section provides a foundational understanding of **backend development**—the invisible but essential part of web applications that handles logic, processing, and data storage.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- **What is the Backend?**  
  The backend is everything that happens "behind the scenes" of a web application. It includes:
  - **Server** – A computer that listens for and responds to client requests.
  - **Application Logic** – Code that handles business logic, processes data, and determines how the app behaves.
  - **Database** – A structured system to store, retrieve, and manage data.

- **Understanding the Server**  
  A server is a machine (often remote) that runs continuously to respond to client (user) requests. In local development, your computer acts as a server using tools like `localhost`.

- **Application Logic Explained**  
  This is the "brain" of the backend—developers write code that interprets user actions, manages data, and controls the application’s responses.

- **Database Role**  
  Databases store persistent data such as user info, content, and app settings. Backend code interacts with the database to read and write this data efficiently.

- **Frontend vs Backend**  
  The frontend is like a restaurant's dining area (user interface), while the backend is the kitchen—handling all the processes that make the visible part work smoothly.

## 🧩 What This Section Sets Up

This section serves as an introduction to backend technologies and concepts that will be explored in greater depth in future sections, including:
- Servers (like Node.js)
- Frameworks (like Express)
- Databases (like MongoDB)
