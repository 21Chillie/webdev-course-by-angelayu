# Structuring API Requests

This session focuses on the essential concepts of API requests and how to format them effectively. Below is a summary of the key points covered:

## API Interaction
- Overview of how front-end and back-end systems communicate through requests and responses.
- Difference between:
  - **Private APIs**: Exclusive to a specific application's front-end.
  - **Public APIs**: Accessible externally with documentation.

## Public API Example
- Introduction to the **[bored-api](https://www.boredapi.com/)**, which provides activities to engage users when bored.
- Emphasis on exploring its documentation to understand available endpoints like:
  - `/random`
  - `/filter`

## API Endpoints
- Explanation of API endpoints.
- How they form the complete request URL when combined with the **base URL**.

## Making Requests
- Demonstrations using **Postman** to make **GET** requests to the bored API.
- Allows users to practice fetching data from defined endpoints.

## Query Parameters
- Introduction to **query parameters**:
  - Add extra information to requests.
  - Formatted as **key/value** pairs.
  - Used for **filtering** and **sorting** data.

## Path Parameters
- Discussion of **path parameters**:
  - Identify specific resources or items within an API.
  - Differentiated from query parameters.
