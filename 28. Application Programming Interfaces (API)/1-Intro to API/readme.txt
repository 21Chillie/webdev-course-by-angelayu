The exercise is to find where the ISS at.

To do that, we use wheretheiss API and get the data with postman.

Here is the api link:
https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544/tles

Then paste that in postman and send get request with that link it will return an JSON Object. Then you copy and paste The latitude and longitude to Google Maps to know where the ISS at.
