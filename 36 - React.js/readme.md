# ⏸️ React Section – Temporarily Paused

> **Note**: This section of the course uses an **outdated version of React** (React 16) and does not reflect current best practices (e.g., modern hooks, functional components, or up-to-date tooling).

After review, I’ve decided to **pause this part of the course** and continue learning React from a **more current and up-to-date resource**.

## 🎯 Why This Decision?

- The course teaches older patterns (e.g., class components) that are rarely used in modern React development.
- Industry standards have shifted toward **functional components**, **React Hooks**, and tools like **Vite** or **modern Create React App**.
- Learning from an outdated foundation could lead to confusion or bad habits when working on real-world projects or job interviews.

## 🔜 Next Steps

I’ll be switching to a **recent, well-maintained learning resource** that covers:

- React 18+ features
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks)
- Modern project structure
- Best practices used in 2025
