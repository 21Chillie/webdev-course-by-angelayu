# 🖥️ Section 21 – Unix Command Line & Bash Shell

This section introduces the Unix command line and the **Bash shell**, essential tools for web developers and backend work. It explains both the theory and practical utility of using the command line over graphical interfaces.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- **What is a Shell?**  
  The shell acts as a bridge between the user and the system's kernel. This section introduces **Bash (Bourne Again SHell)** as the primary command-line interpreter in Unix-like systems.

- **CLI vs GUI**  
  Highlights the difference between **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)** like Finder, and **Command Line Interfaces (CLI)**, emphasizing the CLI’s power, flexibility, and speed for development workflows.

- **Why Use the Command Line?**  
  The command line is crucial for:
  - Navigating files quickly
  - Running and writing shell scripts
  - Automating repetitive tasks
  - Managing backend servers and deployments

- **Learning Resources**  
  Angela recommends a free online "**command line tutorial**" that covers both beginner and advanced topics (e.g., `grep`, `curl`, and piping).

## 💡 Takeaway

The command line is a **vital developer tool**. With practice, it becomes an invaluable part of your development toolkit—especially for tasks involving automation, deployment, and working with remote servers.
